== Basic Layouts in Compose

* Lab: LayoutsCodelab

* *Most composables accept an optional modifier parameter to make them more flexible*, enabling the caller to modify them. If you're creating your own composable, consider having a modifier as a parameter, default it to Modifier (i.e. *empty modifier that doesn't do anything*) and apply it to the root composable of your function. In this case:

[source,kotlin]
----
@Composable
fun PhotographerCard(modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {
    Row(modifier) { ... }
}
----

TIP: By convention, the modifier is specified as the first optional parameter of a function. This enables you to specify a modifier on a composable without having to name all parameters.

=== Slot APIs

* *Slot APIs* are a pattern Compose introduces to bring in a layer of customization on top of composables, in this use case, the available Material Components composables.


=== Scaffold

* A *Scaffold* is a layout which implements the basic material design layout structure. You can add things like a TopBar, BottomBar, FAB or a Drawer.

* With the *scaffoldState* you can set the opening state of the drawer(DrawerState.Opened or DrawerState.Closed)


* https://foso.github.io/Jetpack-Compose-Playground/material/scaffold/[Scaffold on Jetpack Compose Playground^]



== State in Jetpack Compose

* you find this codelab also https://io.google/2022/program/c9768969-9e81-4865-9dff-29a2ab1201ea/[here^].

.State in an app
****
*Any value that can change over time.* This is a very broad definition and encompasses everything from a Room database to a variable in a class.
****

.Key idea
****
State determines what is shown in the UI at any particular time.
****

.Default Modifier
****
It's a good practice to provide *a default Modifier* to all composable functions, as it increases reusability. It should appear as the *first optional parameter* in the parameter list, after all required parameters.
****

=== Events in Compose

image::state-ui-update-loop.png[]


.UI Update Loop
[plantuml,svg,align="center"]
----
include::plantuml/ui-update-loop.puml[]
----

.Key idea
****
State is. Events happen.
****

=== Memory in a composable function

image::state-composition-recomposition.png[]


.The Composition
****
a description of the UI built by Jetpack Compose when it executes composables.
****

.Initial composition
****
creation of a Composition by running composables the first time.
****

.Recomposition
****
re-running composables to update the Composition when data changes.
****

* Use Compose's State and MutableState types to make state observable by Compose.



* Fragen:
** Warum muss eine Variable vom Typ `MutableState` oder `State` sein?
*** Das damit Jetpack Compose mitgeteilt wird, dass diese Variable ein Zustand (State) ist und daher observed wird.
*** Jetpack Compose ist nun in der Lage ein recompose durchzuführen, falls diese Variable geändert wird.

** Was bedeutet `remember { ... }`?
*** Die Variable behält auch nach einer Recomposition ihren Wert.
+
[source,kotlin]
----
val count = remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
Text("$count.value")
----

** Was ist der Unterschied zu `by remember`?
+
[source,kotlin]
----
var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0)}
Text("$count")
----

*** var statt val
**** Warum hat man bei remember `val`?
*** kein .value mehr notwendig

** Wie kann man das einfache state-hoisting-Beispiel erweitern, dass zwei Counter zur Verfügung stehen

=== State driven UI

* Compose is a declarative UI framework. Instead of removing UI components or changing their visibility when state changes, we describe how the UI is under specific conditions of state. As a result of a recomposition being called and UI updated, composables might end up entering or leaving the Composition.

.Key idea
****
If the UI is what the user sees, the UI state is what the app says they should see. Like two sides of the same coin, the UI is the visual representation of the UI state. Any changes to the UI state are immediately reflected in the UI.
****


==== Layout Inspector

image::state-layout-inspector.png[]


==== Enabling the Button

[source,kotlin]
----
Button(
    onClick = { count++ },
    Modifier.padding(top = 8.dp),
    enabled = count < 10 // <.>
) {
    Text("Add one")
}
----

<.> enabling / disabling of the button


=== Remember in Composition

.remember
****
stores objects in the Composition, and forgets the object if the source location where `remember` is called is not invoked again during a recomposition.
****


=== Restore state in Compose

==== rememberSaveable

* restore state across recompositions
* and across configuration changes
** change orientation
** toggle dark mode
** ...

[source,kotlin]
----
var count by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(0) }
----

=== State hoisting

==== key concepts

* A *stateful composable* owns state
** less reusable
** harder to test
* A *stateless composable* doesn't hold any state and is therefore
** easier to test
* *State hoisting* is a pattern of moving state to a composable's *caller* to make a composable stateles
** Single-source-of-truth
** can be shared with multiple composables
** it is interceptable by callers that can decide to ignore or modify the state
* decouples the state from the composable itself

image::state01-key-concepts.png[]

==== Hoisting

* Name des Patterns: Unidirectional DataFlow (UDF)

* *State hoisting* in Compose is a pattern of moving state to a composable's caller to make a composable stateless. The general pattern for state hoisting in Jetpack Compose is to replace the state variable with two parameters, where this value represents any state that could be modified:

** *value: T* - the current value to display
** *onValueChange: (T) -> Unit* - an event that requests the value to change, where T is the proposed new value

.Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF)
****
The *pattern* where the state goes down, and events go up is called *Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF)*, and *state hoisting* is how we *implement this architecture in Compose*. You can learn more about this in the Compose https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/architecture#udf-compose[Architecture documentation^].
****



image::state02-hoisting1.png[]

image::state03-hoisting2.png[]


* State that is hoisted this way has some important properties:

** *Single source of truth*: By moving state instead of duplicating it, we're ensuring there's only one source of truth. This helps avoid bugs.
** *Shareable*: Hoisted state can be shared with multiple composables.
** *Interceptable*: Callers to the stateless composables can decide to ignore or modify events before changing the state.
** *Decoupled*: The state for a stateless composable function can be stored anywhere. For example, in a ViewModel.


==== Stateful vs Stateless

.A stateless composable
****
is a composable that doesn't own any state, meaning it doesn't hold or define or modify new state.
****

.A stateful composable
****
is a composable that owns a piece of state that can change over time.
****

* In real apps, having a 100% stateless composable can be difficult to achieve depending on the composable's responsibilities. You should design your composables in a way that they will own as little state as possible and allow the state to be hoisted, when it makes sense, by exposing it in the composable's API.



* *Key Point*: When hoisting state, there are three rules to help you figure out where state should go:

. State should be hoisted to at least the lowest common parent of all composables that use the state (read).
. State should be hoisted to at least the highest level it may be changed (write).
. If two states change in response to the same events they should be hoisted to the same level.

* You can hoist the state higher than these rules require, but if you don't hoist the state high enough, it might be difficult or impossible to follow unidirectional data flow.

=== ViewModel

ViewModels provide the UI state and access to the business logic located in other layers of the app. Additionally, ViewModels survive configuration changes, so they have a longer lifetime than the Composition. They can follow the lifecycle of the host of Compose content—that is, activities, fragments, or the destination of a Navigation graph if you're using Compose Navigation.

.WARNING
****
ViewModels are not part of the Composition. Therefore, you should not hold state created in composables (for example, a remembered value) because this could cause memory leaks.
****

import androidx.compose.runtime.toMutableStateList
import androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel

class WellnessViewModel : ViewModel() {
    private val _tasks = getWellnessTasks().toMutableStateList()

    val tasks : List<WellnessTask>
        get() = _tasks    // <.>

    fun remove(item: WellnessTask) {
        _tasks.remove(item)
    }

    fun changeTaskChecked(item: WellnessTask, checked: Boolean) =
        tasks.find { it.id == item.id }?.let { task ->    // <.>
            task.checked = checked
        }
}


private fun getWellnessTasks() = List(30) { i ->
    WellnessTask(i, "Task # $i")
}

.Verwendung des ViewModels
[source,kotlin]
----
@Composable
fun WellnessScreen(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    wellnessViewModel: WellnessViewModel = viewModel()  // <.>
    ) {
    Column(modifier = modifier) {
        StatefulCounter()

        WellnessTasksList(
            list = wellnessViewModel.tasks,
            onCloseTask = { task -> wellnessViewModel.remove(task)})
    }
}
----

<.> viewModel() returns an existing ViewModel or creates a new one in the given scope. The ViewModel instance is retained as long as the scope is alive. For example, if the composable is used in an activity, viewModel() returns the same instance until the activity is finished or the process is killed.

//--

* ViewModels are recommended to be used at screen-level composables, that is, close to a root composable called from an activity, fragment, or destination of a Navigation graph.
* ViewModels should never be passed down to other composables, instead you should pass only the data they need and functions that perform the required logic as parameters.

* Check the https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state#viewmodels-source-of-truth[ViewModel and state holders section^] and our https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#viewmodel[Compose and other libraries^] documentation to learn more.


=== Problem

* Run the app and try to check any task. Notice that checking any task doesn't quite work yet.
+
This is because what Compose is tracking for the MutableList are *changes related to adding and removing elements*. This is why deleting works. But it's unaware of changes in the row item values (checkedState in our case), unless you tell it to track them too.

* There are two ways to fix this:

** Change our data class WellnessTask so that checkedState becomes MutableState<Boolean> instead of Boolean, which causes Compose to track an item change.
** Copy the item you're about to mutate, remove the item from your list and re-add the mutated item to the list, which causes Compose to track that list change.

* There are pros and cons to both approaches. For example, depending on your implementation of the list you're using, removing and reading the element might be costly.

.neue data class
[source,kotlin]
----
data class WellnessTask (
    val id: Int,
    val label: String,
    var checked: MutableState<Boolean> = mutableStateOf(false)
)
----

== Advanced State and Side Effects in Jetpack Compose

=== Consuming a Flow from the ViewModel

* We want our UI in the `CraneHomeContent` composable to update whenever there's a new item emitted into the `suggestedDestinations` stream of data.

* We can use the *`StateFlow.collectAsState()`* function. When used in a composable function, `collectAsState()` collects values from the `StateFlow` and represents the latest value via Compose's State API. This will make the Compose code that reads that state value recompose on new emissions.


[source,kotlin]
----
import androidx.compose.runtime.collectAsState

@Composable
fun CraneHomeContent(
    onExploreItemClicked: OnExploreItemClicked,
    openDrawer: () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    viewModel: MainViewModel = viewModel(),
) {
    val suggestedDestinations by viewModel.suggestedDestinations.collectAsState() // <.>
    // ...
}
----

<.> Hier wird festgelegt, daß die Collection suggestedDestinations ein State ist, also observable ist, wodurch bei Änderung die UI automatisch aktualisiert wird


* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38250022/what-does-by-keyword-do-in-kotlin[What does 'by' keyword do in Kotlin?^]

//--

* Compose also offers APIs for Android's most popular stream-based solutions:
** LiveData.observeAsState()
** Observable.subscribeAsState()


=== LaunchedEffect and rememberUpdatedState

* In the project, there's a home/LandingScreen.kt file that's not used at the moment. We want to add a *landing screen* to the app, which potentially could be used to *load all the data needed in the background*.

* The landing screen will occupy the whole screen and show the app's logo in the middle of the screen. Ideally, we'd show the screen and—after all the data's been loaded—we'd notify the caller that the landing screen can be dismissed using the onTimeout callback.

* *Kotlin coroutines are the recommended way to perform asynchronous operations* in Android. An app would usually use coroutines to load things in the background when it starts. Jetpack Compose offers APIs that make using coroutines safe within the UI layer. As this app doesn't communicate with a backend, we'll use the coroutines' delay function to simulate loading things in the background.

.side-effect in Compose
****
A side-effect in Compose is a change to the state of the app that happens outside the scope of a composable function. For example, opening a new screen when the user taps on a button, or showing a message when the app doesn't have Internet connection.
****

* Changing the state to show/hide the landing screen will happen in the *onTimeout callback* and since before calling onTimeout we need to load things using coroutines, the state change needs to happen in the context of a coroutine!

.home/LandingScreen.kt file
[source,kotlin]
----
import androidx.compose.runtime.getValue
import androidx.compose.runtime.rememberUpdatedState

@Composable
fun LandingScreen(modifier: Modifier = Modifier, onTimeout: () -> Unit) {
    Box(modifier = modifier.fillMaxSize(), contentAlignment = Alignment.Center) {
        // This will always refer to the latest onTimeout function that
        // LandingScreen was recomposed with
        val currentOnTimeout by rememberUpdatedState(onTimeout)

        // Create an effect that matches the lifecycle of LandingScreen.
        // If LandingScreen recomposes or onTimeout changes,
        // the delay shouldn't start again.
        LaunchedEffect(true) {
            delay(SplashWaitTime)
            currentOnTimeout()
        }

        Image(painterResource(id = R.drawable.ic_crane_drawer), contentDescription = null)
    }
}
----

.Showing the landing screen
[source,kotlin]
----
// home/MainActivity.kt file

import androidx.compose.runtime.getValue
import androidx.compose.runtime.mutableStateOf
import androidx.compose.runtime.remember
import androidx.compose.runtime.setValue

@Composable
private fun MainScreen(onExploreItemClicked: OnExploreItemClicked) {
    Surface(color = MaterialTheme.colors.primary) {
        var showLandingScreen by remember { mutableStateOf(true) }
        if (showLandingScreen) {
            LandingScreen(onTimeout = { showLandingScreen = false })
        } else {
            CraneHome(onExploreItemClicked = onExploreItemClicked)
        }
    }
}
----

=== rememberCoroutineScope

* Manche Compose APIs sind suspend functions. ZB zum Öffnen des navigation drawers

* Grund dafür: Das Öffnen des Drawers benötigt Zeit, Bewegung und vielleicht auch Animationen. Die Suspend-Function unterbricht die Ausführung der Coroutine an der Stelle wovon sie aufgerufen wird. Nach Fertigstellung der Coroutine wird die Ausführung fortgesetzt.

* scaffoldState.drawerState.open() must be called within a coroutine. What can we do? openDrawer is a simple callback function, therefore:

** We cannot simply call suspend functions in it because openDrawer is not executed in the context of a coroutine.
** We cannot use LaunchedEffect as before because we cannot call composables in openDrawer. We're not in the Composition.

* We want to be able to launch a coroutine which scope should we use? Ideally, we'd want a CoroutineScope that follows the lifecycle of its call-site. To do this, use the *rememberCoroutineScope* API. The scope will be automatically cancelled once it leaves the Composition. With that scope, you can start coroutines when you're not in the Composition, for example, in the openDrawer callback.

[source,kotlin]
----
// home/CraneHome.kt file

import androidx.compose.runtime.rememberCoroutineScope
import kotlinx.coroutines.launch

@Composable
fun CraneHome(
    onExploreItemClicked: OnExploreItemClicked,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
) {
    val scaffoldState = rememberScaffoldState()
    Scaffold(
        scaffoldState = scaffoldState,
        modifier = Modifier.statusBarsPadding(),
        drawerContent = {
            CraneDrawer()
        }
    ) {
        val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()  // <.>
        CraneHomeContent(
            modifier = modifier,
            onExploreItemClicked = onExploreItemClicked,
            openDrawer = {
                scope.launch {
                    scaffoldState.drawerState.open() // <.>
                }
            }
        )
    }

==== LaunchedEffect vs rememberCoroutineScope

* https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/side-effects#launchedeffect[LaunchedEffect: run suspend functions in the scope of a composable^]

* https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/side-effects#remembercoroutinescope[rememberCoroutineScope: obtain a composition-aware scope to launch a coroutine outside a composable^]

IMPORTANT: Using LaunchedEffect in this case wasn't possible because we needed to trigger the call to create a coroutine in a regular callback that was outside of the Composition.
